			<h2 class="mb-5 text-center">The problems we identified</h2>
			<p>Journalism and content creation funding is in CRISIS. Without a free, unbiased and unconflicted press, extremism and populism continues to rise, 
				society is heading towards a post-truth and post-fact era.
			</p>
			<p>Social and tabloid incumbents have destroyed consumer trust. A new solution must return trust and accountability, it must admonish and remove fake, misleading and unverified news and it must be attributable.</p>
			<p>Advertising earnings are disappearing thanks to a collapse of both print and digital revenue, accelerated by ad-blockers and social media data capture. </p>
			<p>Established brands seem unable or unwilling to adapt to changing reader trends, digital innovations or user demands for privacy. </p>

			<h2 class="my-5 text-center">How it works</h2>
                



			<p class="lead">
				<strong>Pay readers to consume content</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="mb-5">
				As Readers simply consume content, ByWire™ rewards them with some Wirebit™ (WIRE). Named the Universal Basic Rewards or UBR, ByWire™ asks Readers, if they enjoyed or appreciated content, to tip some, all or even more WIRE to the Creator and/or Publisher. 
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
            <strong>Transform Pay-Per-Click advertising</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="mb-5">
				Publishers can top up their ByWire™ provided UBR by purchasing Wirebit™ tokens and applying them to their content
			</p>
			
			<p class="lead">
            <strong>News stored on the blockchain, decentralised and trustless</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="mb-5">
				All content will be decentralised, stored on the IPFS with revisions and hashes stored on the EOS mainnet. 
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
            <strong>Less fake news</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="mb-5">
				Fake news and those who purvey it will be quickly identified by a unique and multi-thread process including algorithms, token incentives, community validation and Reader gamification. 
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
            <strong>Personalised, but private</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="mb-5">
				AI/ML will be used to personalise each Readers experience, with habits hidden from ByWire™ to ensure privacy, alternatively Readers can opt for a curated experience. 
			</p>
			<p class="lead">
            <strong>Wordpress and cloud enterprise solutions</strong>
			</p>
			<p class="mb-5">
				Publishers can post content directly to ByWire™, but many will want to control their own websites, therefore they may opt for the hosted cloud solution or the free/premium WordPress plugins, which are coming soon.
			</p>

            <h2 class="my-5 text-center">ByWire is decentralised</h2>
