                <p class="lead">ByWire news is a unique offering; we want to pay you to read the news...Read on to see how or <a class="underline" href="/account/signup">just create a FREE account RIGHT NOW</a> and start earning.</p>
                
                <p>The problems in today's news media stems from centralised ownership; billionaires purchase news outlets to launder their reputations and buy influence. Advertisers can dictate editorial style and censor inconvenient news stories. This can lead to an impartial and unbalanced news environment which gets saturated by fake or misleading publishers. 
                </p>
                <p>The time for a revolution in news funding is here, and ByWire has a plan to help generate wealth and access to capital for all our Readers, Creators and Publishers. Creating a unique, deflationary EOS token called Wirebit (WIRE), with a market cap of more than $10m, ByWire will pay every Reader each time they read any article on the decentralised news network. Some of this Reward will be shared with the creator of the article and the publisher. This all happens automatically and instantly, via the ByWire Smart Contract, every time an article is read by a unique account. 
                </p>
                <p>Readers are then given the chance to Reward their free Wirebit back to content creators and publishers in the form of tips. If you like an article, Reward the author so they can continue to produce this work. If not, do nothing, you still earned some free Wirebit anyway. 
                </p>

                <p>Wirebits tokens can be traded out for EOS or any other cryptocurrency via the <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://dexeos.io/trade/?market=eos&code=wirebittoken&symbol=WIRE">DEXEOS decentralised exchange</a>, then into fiat via something like Coinbase. But, those with the most Wirebit tokens, who stake their tokens, will be able to influence the ByWire network and corporate governance, Only those who are staking their tokens can vote on the democratic principles of the ByWire network including the management of the tokenonsmics. ByWire will also pay an interest rate for each day users stake their Wirebit tokens, generating an ever greater return for all stakeholders. 
                </p>
                <p>Given that Wirebit is a deflationary token, we suggest making a purchase of as many Wirebit tokens as possible as soon as possible. The prices are likely to rise substantially as the network grows, but the supply of Wirebits remains fixed.
                </p>
                <p>Those with the most Wirebits will have the most influence on the platform and will be able to sell them for a likely profit to new corporate clients as they join the ByWire decentralised news network and require Wirebit tokens to top up their Universal Basic Rewards, providing greater prominence and influence on the network.   
                </p>
                <p>ByWire is considering holding a launch event, where all Wirebit tokens will be reduced in costs for a short period of time.
